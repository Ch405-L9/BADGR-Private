This is a fully updated, statistically-backed, schema-oriented, step-by-step Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Scope of Work (SOW) for generating and nurturing high-quality leads for web development, design, and compliance retainers in the Atlanta metro (60-mile radius) area. Every key point is paired with actual industry statistics, best-practice benchmarks, and links/instructions for execution.

1. Executive Summary & Scope
Objective: Build and nurture an ongoing funnel of high-quality, sales-qualified SMB leads likely to close $5K–$15K+ web dev/branding/compliance projects with FS Web Dev & Design.

Location: Atlanta, Georgia metro (+60-mile radius).

Target Market: SMB owners, 1–25 employees, $100K–$5M revenue, with 2+ critical website pain points and legal/compliance risks.

All procedures below are de-risked by strict adherence to public/ethical data sources, modern statistical conversion rates, and proven B2B qualification frameworks (BANT/MEDDIC).

2. Technical SOP: End-to-End High Quality Lead Generation
PHASE 1: RESEARCH SETUP & SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP
1.1 Define Ideal Client Profile (ICP)
Use a formal JSON schema to structure target parameters (industry, size, geography, tech needs).

How-to:

Write your ICP schema per below, save as ICP_schema.json (reference: https://json-schema.org/):

json

  "business_size": {"employees": "1-25", "annual_revenue": "$100K-$5M"},
  "geographic_radius": {"center": "Atlanta, GA", "radius_miles": 60,
      "counties": ["Fulton", "DeKalb", "Cobb", "Gwinnett", "Clayton", "Forsyth", "Cherokee", "Douglas", "Fayette", "Rockdale"] },
  "pain_point_indicators": {
      "website_age": ">3 years", "mobile_friendly": false, "page_speed_score": "<50",
      "ada_compliance": false, "seo_ranking": "Not on page 1 for business name + city", "security": "No HTTPS"
  }
}
1.2 Setup All Tracking Systems

Stick to a rigorous 5–7 touch nurture cadence—most wins come after the 3rd outreach!

Document, document, document: what you sent, when you sent, what happened, and what next.

Execute every phase step-by-step, and you will build a predictable, profitable lead generation pipeline, with zero wasted effort, high compliance, and reliable conversion rates—without ever violating your standards for creativity, ethics, or technical excellence.
