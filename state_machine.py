"""Simple state machine for the LeadGen Audit pipeline.

This module manages progression through the eight phases defined in
the build protocol. State is persisted to a JSON file so that the
pipeline can resume after interruptions. Only phaseÂ 1 (preflight)
is implemented at present; placeholder stubs are provided for later
phases.

To run the first phase directly from the command line, execute this
module as a script::

    python -m leadgen_audit.state_machine
